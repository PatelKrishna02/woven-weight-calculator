# Woven Screen Weight Calculator

A lightweight browser-based calculator used to estimate the weight (in kilograms) of woven wire screens for freight quotes. Built as a standalone HTML/CSS/JavaScript tool – no backend or server required.

Originally developed for internal use at **Nepean Rubber & Plastics**, and suitable for SCS-style screens as well.

## 🔧 Inputs

- **Aperture (OPG)** – opening size in mm  
- **Wire DIA** – wire diameter in mm  
- **Width (Trim Dim 1)** – screen width in mm  
- **Length (Trim Dim 2)** – screen length in mm  

The tool applies the internal weight formula and returns:

- **Total screen weight in kg (2 decimal places)**  
- A rolling **calculation history** for the current browser session.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. Enter the four measurements and click **Calculate Weight**.

No installation or server configuration is required.
